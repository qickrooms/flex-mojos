#summary Roadmap for flex-mojos 2

= Introduction =

The next flex-mojos version focus will be stability, documentation and standardization.


= Goals =
== Refactories ==
  * Refactory all package names to info.flexmojos.MOJO_NAME
  * Change all groupIds to info.flex-mojos
  * Change all artifactIds to maven-MOJO_NAME-plugin
  * Pass on PMD
  * Pass on checkstyle
  * Add equivalence relation on every parameter. Like this:
This is equivalent to using the <code>actionscript-file-encoding</code> option of the mxmlc or compc compilers.
  * Improve maven-doc on parameters who only have equivalence relation
  * Add expression to parameters
  * Add samples on complex parameters
  * Improve error messages (MojoExecutionException), add fix suggestion where is possible and move to resource-bundle files (need see maven standard for this)

== New features ==
=== on compiler ===
  * Improve resource-bundle dependency resolution, just add dependency without classifier, and resolve it at runtime according with locale
  * Add flexSdkVersion, this will add all SDK dependencies (playerglobal, flex, framework, rpc, utilities and their resource-bundles)


== New mojos ==
  * Generation of optimised RSLs (http://code.google.com/p/flex-mojos/issues/detail?id=34)
